# Public Transportation Analysis Project

This repository contains the code and resources for my Public Transportation Analysis project. In this project, I have performed data preprocessing, visualization, and prediction using Cognos and machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To analyze and improve public transportation systems in a specific region.
- **Tools Used**: Cognos.
- **Data Sources**:'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rednivrug/unisys?select=20140711.CSV'

## Project Structure

- **data**: 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rednivrug/unisys?select=20140711.CSV'
- **notebooks**: Google colab for data preprocessing, visualization, and prediction.
- **requirements**: cognoz tool is required for the project.

## Data Preprocessing

In this project, I performed data preprocessing, which included:

- cleaning
- removing duplicates
- replacing null value
- finding the sum of null values
- finding the total of duplicates

## Data Visualization

I used Cognos for data visualization and created various visualizations to gain insights into public transportation data. Some of the visualizations include:
